# EDGE Training Management Portal Automation
This project is a GitHub-based automation solution that integrates Playwright for web automation and Pandas for generating synthetic trainee data in Excel. The script automates the batch creation process for government training by first generating random trainee details (name, phone number, email, organization, and designation) and saving them in an Excel file. Then, using Playwright, it logs into the training portal, navigates through the UI, fills out the batch creation form, uploads the generated Excel file, and submits the form. The automation ensures the process is completed successfully by verifying confirmation messages. The project is structured with modular components, including a dedicated data generator, Playwright script, and logging system, making it scalable and maintainable. By integrating GitHub Actions, this script can be scheduled to run automatically, enabling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for training batch management.
